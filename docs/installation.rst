Installation and configuration
==============================

Installation
============

At the command line::

    $ pip install django-cid


Configuration
=============

You need to add ``cid.apps.CidAppConfig`` to your list of installed apps.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # some apps
        'cid.apps.CidAppConfig',
        # some other apps
    )


Generation of the correlation id
--------------------------------

The correlation id may be generated by ``django-cid`` itself or come
from upstream through an incoming HTTP header.

To let ``django-cid`` generate an id, set ``CID_GENERATE`` to true in
the settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CID_GENERATE = True

By default, ``django-cid`` uses ``str(uuid.uuid4())`` to generate the
correlation id but you can customize this generation to suit your
needs in the settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CID_GENERATOR = lambda: f'{time.time()}-{random.random()}'

Letting ``django-cid`` generate a new correlation id is perfectly
acceptable but does suffer one drawback. If you host your Django
application behind another web server such as nginx, then nginx logs
won't contain the correlation id.
``django-cid`` can handle this by extracting a correlation id created
in nginx and passed through as a header in the HTTP request. For this
to work, you must enable a middleware in the settings, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    MIDDLEWARE = (
        'cid.middleware.CidMiddleware',
        # other middlewares
    )

The middleware takes care of getting the correlation from the HTTP
request header. By default it looks for a header named
``X_CORRELATION_ID``, but you can change this with the ``CID_HEADER``
setting:

.. code-block:: python

    CID_HEADER = 'X_MY_CID_HEADER'

.. note::

    Most WSGI implementations sanitize HTTP headers by appending an
    ``HTTP_`` prefix and replacing ``-`` by ``_``. For example, an
    incoming ``X-Correlation-Id`` header would be available as
    ``HTTP_X_CORRELATION_ID`` in Django. When using such a WSGI server
    in front of Django, the latter, sanitized value should be used in
    the settings.

If a correlation id is provided upstream (e.g. "1234"), it is possible
to concatenate it with a newly generated one. The cid will then look
like ``1234, 1aa38e4e-89c6-4655-9b8e-38ca349da017``. To do so, use the
following settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CID_GENERATE = True
    CID_CONCATENATE_IDS = True

This is useful when you use a service-oriented architecture and want
to be able to follow a request amongst all systems (by looking at logs
that have the first correlation id that was set upstream), and also on
a particular system (by looking at logs that have the id added by the
system itself).


Inclusion of the correlation id in the response
-----------------------------------------------

By default ``django-cid`` sets an HTTP header in the HTTP response
with the same name as configured in ``CID_HEADER``. You may customize
it with ``CID_RESPONSE_HEADER`` in the settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CID_RESPONSE_HEADER = 'X-Something-Completely-Different'

.. note::

    As indicated in the note above, if Django is behind a WSGI server
    that sanitizes HTTP headers, you need to customize
    ``CID_RESPONSE_HEADER`` if you want the same header name in the
    response as in the request.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Nginx sets ``X-Correlation-Id`` but it is sanitized by the WSGI server.
        CID_HEADER = 'HTTP_X_CORRELATION_ID'
        # Don't use the default value (equal to CID_HEADER) for the response header.
        CID_RESPONSE_HEADER = 'X-Correlation-Id'

If you don't want the header to appear in the HTTP response, you must
explicitly set ``CID_RESPONSE_HEADER`` to ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Don't include the header in the HTTP response.
        CID_RESPONSE_HEADER = None


Inclusion of the correlation id in logs
---------------------------------------

The most useful feature of ``django-cid`` is to include the
correlation id in logs. For this you need to add the
``cid.log.CidContextFilter`` log filter in your log settings, apply it
to each logger, and customize the formatter(s) to include the ``cid``
variable.

Here is what it looks like on the the default logging configuration
provided by Django's ``startproject``. Changed lines are highlighted.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5, 8, 18-22, 26

    LOGGING = {
        'version': 1,
        'formatters': {
            'verbose': {
                'format': '[cid: %(cid)s] %(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(module)s %(message)s'
            },
            'simple': {
                'format': '[cid: %(cid)s] %(levelname)s %(message)s'
            },
        },
        'handlers': {
            'console': {
                'level': 'INFO',
                'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
                'formatter': 'verbose',
                'filters': ['correlation'],
            },
        },
        'filters': {
            'correlation': {
                '()': 'cid.log.CidContextFilter'
            },
        },
        'loggers': {
            'testapp': {
                'handlers': ['console'],
                'filters': ['correlation'],
                'propagate': True,
            },
        },
    }

You can then use your loggers as you normally do, safe in the
knowledge that you can tie them all back to the correlation id.

If you want to include the correlation id in all logs, you need to
tweak the "root" key like this:

.. code-block:: python

    LOGGING = {
        # ...
        'root': {
            'level': 'INFO',
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'filters': ['correlation'],
        },
        # ...
    }



Inclusion of the correlation id in SQL queries
----------------------------------------------

``django-cid`` can add the correlation id as a comment before the SQL
query so that the correlation id appears in your database logs like
this:

.. code:: sql

    /* cid: 1234567-68e8-45fc-85c1-e025e5dffd1e */
    SELECT col FROM table

For this you need to change your database backend to one that is
provided by ``django-cid``. For example, for sqlite3 you need to use
the following:

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'cid.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': location('db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }

``django-cid`` has a wrapper for all backends that are currently
supported by Django. Here is the full list:

mysql
    cid.backends.mysql
oracle
    cid.backends.oracle
postgis
    cid.backends.postgis
postgresql
    cid.backends.postgresql
sqlite3
    cid.backends.sqlite3

By default, the correlation id appears as shown in the example above.
You may change that by defining a ``CID_SQL_COMMENT_TEMPLATE`` that is
a string with a ``cid`` format parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    CID_SQL_COMMENT_TEMPLATE = 'correlation={cid}'


Inclusion of the correlation id in templates
--------------------------------------------

``django-cid`` provides a template context processor that adds the
correlation id to the template context if it is available. To enable
it, you need to add it in the list of ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``
in the settings:

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        # other template processors
        'cid.context_processors.cid_context_processor',
    )

It will add a context variable ``correlation_id`` if a correlation id
is available. You may include it in your template with the follwing
snippet:

.. code-block:: django

    {% if correlation_id %}
        <meta name="correlation_id" content="{{ correlation_id }}">
    {% endif %}
