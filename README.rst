Logging is important. Anyone who has had a call at 3am to say the site
is down knows this. Without quality logging it is almost impossible to
work out what on earth is happening.

The more you log, the harder it is to track down exactly what the
effects of a particular request are. Enter Django Correlation ID.
Incoming requests are assigned a unique identifier. This can either
happen in your public facing web server (e.g. nginx) or be applied
by Django itself.

This correlation id (also known as request id) is then available
through the Django request/response cycle and may be automatically
included in all log messages. That way, you can easily link all log
messages that relate to the same request::

    2018-10-01T08:18:39.86+00:00 correlation_id=2433d5d4-27a3-4889-b14b-107a131368a3 Call to plug from cpoint=1
    2018-10-01T08:18:39.90+00:00 correlation_id=72fbd7dd-a0ba-4f92-9ed0-0db358338e86 Call to state by cpoint=2 with {'state': {'B': 'idle', 'A': 'on_charge'}}
    2018-10-01T08:18:39.92+00:00 correlation_id=2433d5d4-27a3-4889-b14b-107a131368a3 Ended rental=7 customer="John Smith" on plug

In this example, we can see that the first and the third log messages
are tied to the same request, while the second message relates to a
distinct request.

In addition to these logs, ``django-cid`` can include the correlation
id:

- in all SQL queries (as a comment);
- in rendered templates;
- as a header in the HTTP response generated by Django;
- and possibly anywhere by using the API of ``django-cid``, for
  example as an HTTP header on a request to another internal system of
  yours, which is especially useful in service-oriented architecture.
